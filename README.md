Big Data Exercise 1:

Graph conclusions:

# plot Week3_Mean_daily_power 

A graph showing the daily average of electricity consumption on 07/02/21-14/02/21
It can be seen that the highest power consumption was on 12/02/2021

# plot Week3_Minute_power_demand_1 

You can see that all five station lines go up towards evening hours (16:00-18:00). In the evening there is more electricity demand.

# plot Week3_Minute_power_demand_2 

You can see that in the late evening (20:00-22:00) there is a high electricity demand and as you get to late at night (before dawn) the electricity demand decreases because during these hours people sleep so there is no demand for electricity.
